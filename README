Sentry - a simple, lightweight password server

We all know that passwords are hard to remember. This is even so if you are meticulous person who uses a 
different password for every scenario. It becomes really difficult to keep track of all your passwords.

Traditional ways of solving this includes password management software that lets you use one master password to 
view & edit every password you have. You can have one entry to store your passwords for your school's
website, one for you amazon account etc.

Password management software solves the problem pretty nicely, but it becomes difficult to manage if you
are away from your normal computer, or if you have multiple computers yourself. You won't have access
to passwords stored on another machine. 

To solve this, Sentry is a lightweight password server that can be easily accessed anywhere (with internet
access). Your master password is hashed before stored, and all other passwords are stored using AES that
can only be unlocked by your master key. All communications between you and the server are secure through
RSA.
